### Welcome to my blog

I love to write and read about how humans using technology could make dreams come true. Because our dreams makes our world a better place.

### My Name is Dudi Levy

I'm Entrepreneur and Advisor to internet, mobile & gaming companies
Technology for me is a tool where you can create and make amazing products.

Product for me is to create a something that will change, enrich or make an impact on other people lives.
(Having fun playing games is a great enrichment I love to create).

And leadership is about empowering people working together towards a greater goal, where each of them alone can not achieve.

Feel free to connect with me via my LinkedIn or Twitter accounts.
I would love to hear your feedback!
